How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    one file with small letters and other with cap with *s

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    we can see the history of different versions of file so it will be easier to track down

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    manually doing is great because we have control over it

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because if we have updated several files for a single commit it will reflect in all the files that  we have changed in the new version of files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	git log helps us to view the different versions of a file with the dates when they are created and an unique id. On the other hand git diff is used to view the difference between two files like how many files are added and how many are deleted

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    because it helps us to go back to the older thing easily and we can see which commit creates the bug by comparing the buggie commit with the non buggie commit

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    try to mesh up things
