What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	git creates a hidden file named .git .
	Because git uses that file to store the history of our work or files in order to give us the benefit of version control

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	staging area is kind temporary place where we can put the files that is to be commited. Whereas working directory is a directory where all the necessary files is stored for our work and the repository is a term in git where all the files, history, commit information etc.. for a specific project is stored
