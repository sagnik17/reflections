How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Whereas working directory is a directory where all the necessary files is stored for our work and the repository is a term in git where all the files, history, commit information etc.. for a specific project is stored

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	We can store the changes in staging area. then do a git diff to find out the changes between the working directory and the staging area so that it will be clear before commiting what permanent changes we want.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
