When would you wnat to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local ?
  when I want to share something or want some contributors from remote locations to my project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Because we not want some changes made by others in the first place
