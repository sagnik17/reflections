When would you wnat to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local ?
  when I want to share something or want some contributors from remote locations to my project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Because we not want some changes made by others in the first place

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  fork is for copying all the files from someone else's account to my account
  on GitHub, while clones refers to bring the files from the GitHub account to
  my local computer whereas branches to create a new branch for specific task
  in my local computer

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  when someone else made a change to the copy which is in GitHub then we can
  ensure that by fetching those changes to our remote version that is stored
  locally and then comparing that with our own local copy.
